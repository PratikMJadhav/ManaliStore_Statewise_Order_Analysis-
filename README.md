## 5) Insights:

🔹 1. Maharashtra leads in total sales
Maharashtra recorded the highest sales with approximately ₹4.36M, followed by Karnataka (₹3.85M) and Uttar Pradesh (₹2.81M).
These three states are your most lucrative markets.

🔹 2. March had the highest number of orders
The order volume peaks in March, even though revenue doesn’t spike significantly after that. This could imply smaller order values or higher discounts.

🔹 3. Women drive the majority of sales
Women contributed to 64% of the total sales, compared to 36% by men.
This indicates that women-focused marketing could further boost growth.

🔹 4. Adults are your main customer segment
Adults (both men and women) account for the highest share of sales (76.28% combined).
Seniors and young customers contribute relatively less, with seniors making up only ~19%.

🔹 5. Amazon is the top-performing channel
Amazon contributed to 35% of the sales share.
Flipkart is next (22%), followed by Meesho and others.
Consider investing more in Amazon promotions and possibly expanding presence on Flipkart.

🔹 6. Delivery success rate is excellent
A remarkable 92% of orders were delivered successfully.
Returns (3%), refunds (2%), and cancellations (3%) are well within acceptable limits.

🔹 7. Consistent sales trend throughout the year
Sales and orders remain relatively stable month-to-month with only slight fluctuations.
No extreme dips, indicating a steady customer base.

🔹 8. Southern and Western India dominate sales
Besides Maharashtra, states like Tamil Nadu, Telangana, and Karnataka show strong demand, suggesting a geographical strength in the south and west zones.

🔹 9. Opportunity to grow in low-sales states
States like Haryana (₹1.08M) and West Bengal (₹1.37M) lag behind others.
These regions could be targeted with regional campaigns or promotions.

 ## 6) Strategies to Increase Sales:

🔹 1. Double Down on High-Performing Channels (Amazon & Flipkart)

Since Amazon drives 35% of sales and Flipkart 22%, increase:
Sponsored listings & ads on these platforms
Exclusive online promotions or bundles
Reviews and product ratings (better-rated products convert more)

🔹 2. Expand in High-Sales States

Invest more in Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu, which already show strong performance.
Offer regional language ads.
Partner with local influencers or micro-influencers.

🔹 3. Target Female Shoppers More Aggressively

With women contributing to 64% of sales, build more:
Women-focused campaigns
Fashion combo deals (e.g., blouse + saree sets)
Loyalty programs tailored to female customers

🔹 4. Promote to Adult Segment with Personalized Offers

Adults dominate sales (>75%). Create age-relevant messaging and:
Offer “workwear collections”, festive sets, or family bundles
Email/SMS campaigns with personalized recommendations

🔹 5. Optimize for Seasonal Peaks (e.g., March)

March sees the highest order volume—use this month for:
Annual sale events
New collection launches
Clearance discounts to move inventory

🔹 6. Upsell in Low-Sales States

States like Haryana, West Bengal, and Andhra Pradesh are underperforming.
Run geo-targeted ads on social media
Offer region-specific products (e.g., ethnic wear popular in Bengal)

🔹 7. Analyze & Promote Best-Performing Categories

Use slicers to find out which categories (e.g., sarees, kurtas) sell best.
Promote best-sellers heavily.
Bundle slow-moving items with fast sellers.

🔹 8. Reduce Returns/Refunds with Better Product Pages

Even though returns/cancellations are low, further reduction helps margins.
Improve product images and sizing guides.
Use videos or customer reviews for clarity.

🔹 9. Introduce Loyalty or Referral Programs

Give cashback or coupons to repeat buyers (especially women and adults).
Introduce a "Refer & Earn" scheme to get more organic traffic.

🔹 10. Add Limited-Time Deals

Create urgency by offering time-limited discounts, e.g.:
 “Buy in the next 2 hours and get 15% off on ethnic wear.”

🔹11. RFM access

If you had access to RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis, that would help you:
Identify top buyers (for exclusive offers)
Re-engage inactive customers with win-back campaigns
